🐧 Linux Summary

Linux is the backbone of most cloud systems. Here's what I learned and how it's used in real-world environments.

📘 What I Learned

- **Basic Commands**: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `nano`, `vim`
- **File Permissions**: `chmod`, `chown`, understanding `rwx` for user, group, others
- **User Management**: `adduser`, `passwd`, `usermod`, `groups`
- **Package Management**:
  - Debian-based: `apt`, `dpkg`
  - RedHat-based: `yum`, `dnf`, `rpm`
- **Processes & System Monitoring**: `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `kill`, `systemctl`
- **File Structure**: Understanding directories like `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/home`, `/bin`
- **Shell Scripting**: Writing `.sh` scripts for automation
- **Remote Access**: Using SSH to connect to cloud servers
- **Logs**: Viewing logs in `/var/log`, using `journalctl`

🚀 Real-World Use Cases

- Managing cloud-based Linux servers (e.g., AWS EC2 instances)
- Writing automation scripts for daily operations
- Monitoring server health and logs
- Running containers (Docker is based on Linux)
- Deploying applications and web servers (Apache, Nginx)

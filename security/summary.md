🔐 Security Summary

Security is a critical part of cloud computing. These are the security fundamentals I’ve learned during my journey.

📘 What I Learned

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**:
  - Users, Groups, Roles, Policies
  - Least privilege principle
- **Encryption**:
  - Data at rest vs. data in transit
  - Services like AWS KMS for key management
- **Authentication Methods**:
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  - Access keys, password policies
- **Network Security**:
  - Security Groups (firewalls for EC2)
  - Network ACLs (stateless filters)
- **Cloud Security Best Practices**:
  - Regular key rotation
  - Logging and auditing with tools like CloudTrail
  - Shared Responsibility Model

🚀 Real-World Use Cases

- Creating secure access to cloud resources
- Managing user permissions and access controls
- Enforcing encryption policies for storage
- Monitoring activity for compliance and auditing
- Protecting apps from external threats

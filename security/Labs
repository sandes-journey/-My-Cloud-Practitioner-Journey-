Security Lab: IAM User and Policy Configuration

Objective  
To configure Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, groups, and policies to control access securely.

Steps Taken  
1. Navigated to the AWS IAM console.  
2. Created IAM users with programmatic access.  
3. Assigned users to groups with specific permission policies.  
4. Developed custom policies in JSON format.  
5. Enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security.  
6. Verified access rights by simulating user logins.

Challenges  
- Over-permissioning users initially, which was corrected by adhering to the principle of least privilege.  
- Complexity in writing correct JSON policy syntax.

Takeaways  
- Developed understanding of secure access control in cloud environments.  
- Learned best practices in permissions management and security hardening.  
- Recognized the critical role of MFA in enhancing account security.

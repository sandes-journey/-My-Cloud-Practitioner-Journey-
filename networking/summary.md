🌐 Networking Summary

Networking is the foundation of communication in the cloud. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve learned.

📘 What I Learned

- **IP Addressing**:
  - IPv4, CIDR notation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`)
- **DNS**:
  - Translating domain names to IP addresses
  - Services like Route 53 (in AWS)
- **Subnets & VPCs**:
  - Isolating resources into different networks
  - Public vs private subnets
- **Routing**:
  - Route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways
- **Ports & Protocols**:
  - Common ports: SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
  - TCP vs UDP
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Distributing traffic across multiple instances
- **Security**:
  - Security groups and NACLs for controlling traffic

🚀 Real-World Use Cases

- Designing secure cloud networks (VPC architecture)
- Connecting hybrid networks (on-premises to cloud)
- Ensuring high availability with load balancers
- Isolating workloads using subnets and route tables
- Securing network traffic through firewall rules
